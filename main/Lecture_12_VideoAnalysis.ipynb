A wide shot reveals the ruins of what was once a vibrant city, now reduced to skeletal structures, twisted metal, and debris. The atmosphere is shrouded in shades of deep blue and grey, contributing to an eerie silence that hangs over the wreckage. Fragments of concrete jut out like the remains of a long-forgotten civilization, while remnants of vehicles peek through the rubble.\\n\\nAs the camera pans slightly to the right, the remnants of a large, ominous structure come into focus, casting long shadows across the cracked ground. The scene is dotted with scattered bones, remnants of what once was, amplifying the sense of loss and despair that permeates the environment.\\n\\nSuddenly, a low drone reverberates through the air. The camera shifts to reveal two flying machines hovering above the ruins, equipped with bright flashing lights. The machines, sleek and menacing, search the debris with powerful searchlights, scanning for any signs of life or activity below. Their red and blue lights cast an unsettling glow over the landscape, accentuating the desolation and the fear that fills the air.\\n\\nClose-up shots of twisted metal and fragmented technology reveal the remnants of a once-thriving society, now devoid of life. Bits of machinery lie dormant amongst the remnants of buildings, hinting at the advanced civilization that once thrived here.\\n\\nIn a haunting moment, the focus narrows on a patch of ground where a figure, partially obscured by shadows, lies among the debris, barely moving. A rapid breath can be seen escaping, showcasing desperation but also resilience.

They went down the hallway!” The climax builds as they realize they’re running out of time.

The camera captures their anxious expressions, showcasing the desperation etched into their features.\\n\\nThe door to the room bursts open, and in a dramatic close-up, we see a police officer sweeping in, illuminated by the harsh light that spills from the corridor. The officer scans the room, a look of determination on his face as he raises his flashlight, illuminating every corner.\\n\\nJust as it seems they might be discovered, a loud crash from elsewhere in the building diverts the officer’s attention. The tension peaks as they risk a glance at each other; hope flickers in their eyes. Seizing the moment, the woman whispers, “We need to move. Now!” \\n\\nWith heart-pounding urgency, they silently slip further into the shadows of the room, choosing not to exit through the door they entered.

With no time to hesitate, the woman expertly climbs the fence, her agility evident as she throws a leg over. The driver is right behind her, struggling momentarily before finally making it over. They land with soft thuds on the other side, momentarily hidden from view.\\n\\nAs they continue to dart through the shadows, the scene shifts to a secret underground compound. The visuals are stark and eerie, illuminated only by the flickering beam of a flashlight held by a grizzled man wearing tactical gear. He moves cautiously, showcasing a sense of purpose mixed with a hint of paranoia.\\n\\nThe camera shifts back to the woman and driver, who find temporary refuge in an abandoned warehouse. Dust motes dance in the air as they huddle together, whispering in hushed voices about a plan. The woman points out a dimly lit exit at the far end of the warehouse, while the driver glances nervously over his shoulder.\\n\\nJust then, the thudding footsteps of officers can be heard approaching, echoing ominously in the stillness.

A wide shot reveals the ruins of what was once a vibrant city, now reduced to skeletal structures, twisted metal, and debris. The atmosphere is shrouded in shades of deep blue and grey, contributing to an eerie silence that hangs over the wreckage.

The setting transitions to a dimly lit room, where the atmosphere is heavy with unspoken words and tension. \\n\\nThe young woman, with tears glistening in her eyes, sits on the edge of a bed, her body language reflecting a mixture of vulnerability and strength. She reaches out gently, brushing her fingers against the driver's shoulder, her expression filled with concern and urgency. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t keep running,\\u201d she whispers, her voice trembling slightly as she searches his gaze for understanding.\\n\\nThe camera captures close-ups of their faces, revealing the emotional toll of their ordeal. The driver, appearing distraught and conflicted, leans forward, his brow furrowed in deep concentration. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t sign up for any of this,\\u201d he snaps, frustration evident in his tone as his hands clench involuntarily. The tension between them is palpable, combining fear, desperation, and a flicker of hope.\\n\\nShe wipes away a tear and steadies her breath, her resolve hardening. \\u201cWe have to find a way out, together.\\u201d Her eyes, though weary, glimmer with a fierce determination. The driver turns away slightly, struggling with his inner turmoil. The moment stretches, silence enveloping them, as they both grapple with the weight of their choices and the danger they face.\\n\\nThe lighting shifts subtly, shadows dancing across the walls, amplifying the sense of impending danger. Outside, the faint sound of sirens echoes, a constant reminder of the reality closing in. As the camera shifts back to their faces, the driver turns to her, a moment of clarity breaking through his confusion. \\u201cYou\\u2019re right. We need a plan.\\u201d\\n\\nThey share a charged gaze, the connection between them deepening. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t let them catch us,\\u201d she insists, her voice firmer now. The driver nods, a newfound determination sparking in his eyes.\\n\\nSuddenly, a loud crash comes from outside, sending both of them jumping. The urgency comes rushing back, and the driver stands abruptly, moving to check the window for any signs of their pursuers. The woman follows closely behind, her heart racing as they both peer into the darkness.\\n\\n\\u201cLet\\u2019s go,\\u201d he says, urgency lacing his words as he grabs her hand firmly. They exchange a last fleeting look, a blend of anxiety and determination, before slipping out of the room and into the unknown, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats, wondering what lies ahead for them. \\n\\nAs the scene fades, the echoes of their footsteps resonate with a mix of hope and despair, setting the stage for the next chapter in their harrowing journey.\",\n          \"The scene begins as we transition from the earlier dramatic moment, shifting our focus away from the devastated landscape of 2029 Los Angeles towards a more intimate, tense scenario. The atmosphere is thick with uncertainty as we see a dimly lit alleyway, where rain slicks the pavement and shadows loom ominously.\\n\\nA figure shrouded in a long, tattered trench coat stealthily navigates through the alley. The camera captures their furtive movements, employing quick cuts to amplify the sense of urgency. The ground is scattered with debris and remnants of a once-bustling urban environment, suggesting a backdrop rich in history yet now steeped in despair.\\n\\nAs the character approaches a vintage photo booth, the neon sign reading \\u201cPhotographs\\u201d flickers intermittently, adding to the unsettling ambiance. With heightened tension, the figure pauses, glancing nervously over their shoulder, and retrieves a weapon\\u2014a small handgun\\u2014from their waistband. The close-up shot of the weapon contrasts sharply with the surrounding decay, symbolizing a desperate attempt at self-preservation.\\n\\nSuddenly, piercing lights blare through the alley, illuminating the darkness. The figure drops to their knees behind a battered police car, heart pounding audibly in silence. The sound of footsteps grows louder, echoing ominously as menacing silhouettes approach, armed and determined.\\n\\nAs the action escalates, the camera angles shift multiple times, emphasizing the tight quarters of the alley while showcasing the growing threat. A rush of adrenaline floods the scene when the character, heart racing, pulls the trigger\\u2014an unexpected confrontation erupts, shattering the eerie silence.\\n\\nThe ensuing chaos is captured in frenetic, oscillating shots as the figure navigates through the onslaught. Quick cuts show brief glimpses of both the shooters and passersby caught in the fray, presenting a stark juxtaposition between chaos and the eerie calm of the earlier ruined setting.\\n\\nIn a climactic moment, amid the cacophony of gunfire, the character executes a daring escape maneuver, climbing onto the restoration of a nearby building. The camera tracks the retreat while the lingering sense of danger permeates the scene, keeping viewers on edge.\\n\\nThe scene shifts to a rooftop overlooking the desolate cityscape once more, where the figure stands bathed in the blue glow of distant flashing lights. Breathing heavily, they survey the chaos below, grappling with the weight of their choices and the harsh reality of survival in a shattered world.\\n\\nThe clip ends on an ominous note, with one fleeting shot of the darkened cityscape as the camera pulls back, leaving viewers with a lingering sense of uncertainty about the fate of the character and the world surrounding them.\",\n          \"The scene picks up with the young woman settled in the backseat of the vehicle, her breath still heavy from sprinting through the chaos outside. The atmosphere is thick with tension as she exchanges rapid glances with the man at the wheel, who grips the steering wheel with white knuckles. Sirens wail from police cars in the distance, creating a frantic drumbeat that echoes her racing heart.\\n\\nIn a tight close-up, her face is illuminated by the flashing lights outside, revealing a mixture of fear and determination. She clutches the edge of the seat, her knuckles white as she fights against the instinct to panic. The driver suddenly accelerates, and the car lurches forward, narrowly avoiding a barrier that appears in the headlights.\\n\\nThe camera shifts to the rearview mirror, capturing the approaching police cars gaining ground. Flashing lights paint the interior of the vehicle in alternating shades of red and blue. The man pushes the accelerator even harder, the engine roaring as they weave through traffic, the city lights blurring into streaks.\\n\\nSuddenly, the driver glances back. \\\"They're right behind us!\\\" he exclaims, urgency threading through his voice. The camera then cuts to the police officers moving in synchronized formation, arms raised, weapons drawn as they chase after the relentless escapees.\\n\\nAs they turn down an alley, the sounds of the city are muffled by the adrenaline coursing through her veins. The woman takes a shaky breath, her resolve hardening as she realizes that this is no longer just about escape; this is a fight for survival. She quickly scans the sidewalk, searching for any escape routes or allies amid the chaos.\\n\\nThe driver executes a sharp turn, and they find themselves at a dead end, the sounds of the sirens echoing ominously behind them. Panic flickers across her face as she shouts, \\\"We need to go back!\\\" But before the driver can respond, bright flashlight beams cut through the darkness, illuminating their vehicle.\\n\\nThe camera shifts outwards, revealing several police cars blocking the exit, officers moving swiftly into position. Their commanding voices carry through the air: \\\"Step out of the vehicle! Hands in the air!\\\" The tension escalates, and the woman shares a glance with the man, desperation reflecting in her eyes. It\\u2019s now or never.\\n\\nDetermined to escape the tightening grip of the law, she suddenly flings open the door and leaps out into the night, heart pounding as she sprints towards a nearby building. The driver hesitates for a moment but quickly follows, both of them moving in sync as they slip through the shadows.\\n\\nThe camera follows closely as they dart into the building, the heavy door slamming shut behind them with a resonating thud. Inside, the atmosphere shifts to one of uncertainty. The dimly lit hallways are narrow, lined with doors that appear to go nowhere.\\n\\nThey find themselves in a waiting room, where scattered papers litter the floor, and a single flickering fluorescent light buzzes overhead. The woman looks around, adrenaline coursing through her as she whispers, \\u201cWe need to hide!\\u201d \\n\\nSuddenly, the loud burst of doors crashing open brings the tension to a climax. The camera pulls back, giving a wide view of the hallway filled with police officers, voices shouting as they attempt to flush out the fugitives.\\n\\nIn a frantic hurry, the woman spots a small room with a narrow entrance. She and the driver duck inside just as footsteps thud heavily outside. The camera captures their reflections against the dusty glass, fear woven into their expressions.\\n\\nOutside, the officers spread out, determinedly scanning the area. The buzzing overhead light flickers ominously, casting eerie shadows that dance across the walls, emphasizing the looming danger. The sound of their frantic shouts reverberates through the building as they draw closer.\\n\\nThe scene cuts to a close-up of the woman, breathing heavily, her resolve hardening as she understands that they must act decisively. The camera gradually zooms out, leaving viewers in suspense, questioning their fate as the officers close in, leaving the screen washed in uncertainty.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "Now we will feed the AI the clip descriptions and have it generate the script for the video. The script will come back as a dataframe called `df_summary_script` with columns `\"narration\"` and `\"clip_path\"`.  We do this with the `generate_summary_script` function.  We just need to give it some `summary_instructions` to tell it how to write the narration.  We can also give it a model. I find `gpt-4o` to be a bit better here than `gpt-4o-mini`.  For the instructions, be creative to get a better video.  "
