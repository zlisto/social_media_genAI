App maker, app maker, make me an app. I would like to make a Streamlit app to chat with an AI pretending to be a person based on their tweets. The tweets are in a csv file with columns text. I want to drag the file into the webpage. Then it will be loaded into a dataframe df. Then I want to call a function in my utils.py file called get_persona_chat_instructions(df) that will return a string which is the instructions for the persona chat telling the AI how to behave. Don’t show the instructions on the screen as they are very long and contain many tweets. Then I want a chat window where the AI message is generated by a function get_ai_response(instructions, messages) that takes as input the persona chat instruction string and the messages in the chat so far, including what the user just typed, formatted as as list appropriate for OpenAI API. I want the app to show animated … while the Ai is generating its message. I want the app to be titled “Persona Chat”
