App maker app maker, make me an app. I would like to make a Streamlit app to analyze tweets. The tweets are in a csv file with columns text, favorite_count, view_count. I want to drag the file into the webpage. Then it will be loaded into a dataframe df. Then I want to calculate a new column engagement which is favorite_count/view_count. Then I want to rank the tweets by engagement in descending order. Then I want to display the tweet text and engagement in a nice table that I can scroll up and down. I want the highest engagement tweet on top. Each time I upload a new csv file, recompute everything. I want the app to be titled â€œTop Tweets
