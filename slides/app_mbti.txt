App maker app maker, make me an app. I would like to make a Streamlit app to compute the Mybers Brigs category of a person based on their tweets. The tweets are in a csv file with columns text. I want to drag the file into the webpage. Then it will be loaded into a dataframe df. Then I will pass the dataframe to a function I wrote in my utils.py file called get_myers_brigs(df) that returns an HTML string summarizing the person’s Mybers Briggs type. I want to display that HTML. While the get_myers_brigs is working, show some spinning wheel so I know its busy thinking and say “Analyzing data…” Redo the computation each time I upload a new csv file. Give the app a cool sounding name to impress VCs
